## [+] This is for educational purposes only. Do not use these python scripts for illegal stuff.[+]

This is a backdoor python project.

It works for any operating system like Windows, MacOS and Linux with python3 interpreter.

You run listener.py on your own machine and run backdoor.py on your target machine you want to hack.

Once you are connected to the target machine, you can run any system commands.

These python scripts work with only python3.

    upload [file_name] --- You can upload any files from your machine to your target machine.

    download [file_name] --- You can download any files from your target machine to your machine.

    exit --- You can exit out of the shell.
